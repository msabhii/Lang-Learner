### Code Explanation

The code for this app is relatively simple. Let's go through it step by step.

First, we import the necessary modules.

```
import Duolingo from "duolingo-api-js";
import express from "express";
import bodyParser from "body-parser";
```

Next, we create an Express app.

```
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
```

We then use the `express.json()` and `bodyParser.urlencoded()` middleware to parse JSON and form data requests, respectively.

```
app.use(express.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
```

We also serve static files from the `public` directory.

```
app.use(express.static("public"));
```

Now, let's look at the routes.

The first route is the root route, which renders the login page.

```
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.render("login.ejs"); // You need to create this view
});
```

The second route is the login route, which handles login requests.

```
app.post("/login", async (req, res) => {
  const username = req.body.username;
  const password = req.body.password;

  try {
    const duo = new Duolingo({ userName: username, password: password });
    await duo.logIn();

    const userData = await duo.getData();

    // Render a page with the user's Duolingo data
    res.render("
